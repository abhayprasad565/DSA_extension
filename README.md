In the realm of competitive programming, where mastery of Data Structures and Algorithms is paramount, maintaining a steadfast practice regimen is the cornerstone of success. However, in today's whirlwind of distractions, fostering unwavering motivation and unwavering focus can be an uphill battle. To overcome this formidable obstacle, we propose a groundbreaking extension that revolutionizes the way individuals approach their Data Structure and Algorithm practice.

In today's digital age, maintaining focus and adhering to daily commitments can be increasingly difficult due to the multitude of distractions available online. For students and professionals striving to improve their coding skills, platforms like Leetcode offer a valuable resource through daily coding challenges. However, despite the best intentions, it can be challenging to consistently solve these problems amidst the digital noise. 

The rationale behind this project is to provide a tangible tool that helps users build and maintain a habit of daily coding practice. The constant redirection to Leetcode acts as a digital reminder and enforcer, ensuring that the user prioritizes their learning. This method leverages behavioral conditioning, making the practice of solving coding problems an ingrained daily activity.

This ingenious extension seamlessly integrates the "Eat That Frog" principle, advocating for the prioritization of the most crucial task at hand, into the daily practice routine. By automatically redirecting users to Data Structure and Algorithm until they have vanquished the daily challenge, the extension empowers individuals to conquer their programming goals with unwavering determination.
